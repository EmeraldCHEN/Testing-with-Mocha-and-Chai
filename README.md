# Testing-with-Mocha-and-Chai
- Mocha is a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on Node.js and in the browser - https://mochajs.org/
 
- Chai is a BDD / TDD assertion library for node and the browser that can be delightfully paired with any javascript testing framework - https://www.chaijs.com/

ℹ️ Cypress bundles the Chai assertion library; Cypress uses Mocha under the hood so Cypress tests are written on top of Mocha's BDD interface adopting Mocha's BDD syntax
